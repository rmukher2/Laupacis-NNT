# Laupacis' NNT

This repository contains R code for __nonparametric__, __parametric__ and __semiparametric__ estimator of Laupacis' NNT with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. This repository also includes 2 datasets, which depicts the practical implications of different methods in calculating __NNT__. Withing the folders __Setup - I__ and __Setup - II__, there are codes when the parametric model is correctly specified, the parametric model is misspecifed and furthermore, when the semiparametric model is misspecifed.
